SYNOPSIS
========

**dbt5-run** [option...] dbms directory

DESCRIPTION
===========

**dbt5-run** is a wrapper script that helps execute a test.  It is intended to
be an easier way to execute the DBT-5 workload than running the individual
components by hand, but does not provide all of the flexibility that can be
achieved by running the individual components by hand.  It additionally aids in
collecting operating system and database statistics as well as capturing
software profiles if the user so desires.

OPTIONS
=======

-b PARAMETERS  Database *parameters*.
-c CUSTOMERS  Active *customers*, default 5000.
-d SECONDS  Test duration in *seconds*.
--dbaas  Flag to signify that the database is a service so only collect
        database statistics.
-f SCALE_FACTOR  Default 500.
--help  This usage message.  Or **-?**.
-h HOSTNAME  Database *hostname*, default localhost.
-l DELAY  Pacing *delay* in seconds, default 0.
-n NAME  Database *name*, default dbt5.
--privileged  Run test as a privileged database user.
-p PORT  Database *port* number.
-r SEED  Random number *seed*, using this invalidates test.
--stats  Collect system stats and profile.
-s DELAY  *delay* between starting threads in milliseconds, default 1000.
--tpcetools=EGENHOME  *egenhome* is the directory location of the TPC-E Tools
-t CUSTOMERS  Total *customers*, default 5000.
-u USERS  Number of *users* to emulate, default 1.
-V, --version  output version information, then exit
-w DAYS  Initial trade *days*, default 300.
-z COMMENT  *comment* describing this test run.

*dbms* options are:

* pgsql  PostgreSQL

*directory* is the path to save test results.

EXAMPLES
========

Run a quick 120 second (2 minute) test with 1 user::

    dbt5 run -d 120 pgsql /tmp/results
